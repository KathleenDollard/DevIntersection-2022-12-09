# DevIntersection-2022-12-09

Thank for coming to one or more of my talks at DevIntersection in Las Vegas!

The best way to reach me is @KathleenDollard on Twitter. If I abandon Twitter try KDollard@microsoft.com

In this repo you'll find subdirectories for each talk with the PowerPoint deck and any other files. For demo code, check out the links below. Demo code is to learn from, and not directly appropriate for your apps. 

Look for the DevIntersection 2022-12 branches. In some cases, Main is empty or massively out of date.
